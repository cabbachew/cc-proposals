    studentBlurb:
      "Winn is a intellectually curious 8th grader at Korematsu Middle who demonstrates exceptional versatility across multiple domains. A gifted musician who has played piano since age 6 and currently participates in advanced, jazz, and symphonic bands, Winn also explores guitar and performs covers with a band. His academic strengths span science, history, and writing, complemented by unique abilities like synesthesia and exceptional memory. While slightly introverted, Winn is well-liked at school and shows deep engagement in his interests, from astrophysics to debate (where he earned a top debater award). His ability to write extensive, thoughtful pieces and his enthusiasm for educational science content reveal his natural inclination toward deep learning.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Passion Project engagement with Pathfinding focuses on helping Winn explore and synthesize his diverse interests in music, science, debate, and creative pursuits. Taking into account his slightly introverted nature, we'll begin with guided exploration of his various passions, gradually identifying potential projects that align with his interests. The pathfinding component will help connect these explorations to future academic and career opportunities, while building a strategic roadmap for high school and beyond. We'll leverage Winn's natural ability to dive deep into subjects while helping him discover meaningful connections between his various interests.",
