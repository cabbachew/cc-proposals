    studentBlurb:
      "Elle is an eighth-grade student at Riverdale Country School with a pragmatic, matter-of-fact approach to learning. She possesses a photographic memory and excels in history, while working to strengthen her analytical skills in science. A social student who becomes talkative once comfortable, Elle enjoys tennis and lacrosse outside of school. Her initial shyness gives way to engagement when discussing topics that interest her, particularly real estate development and urban planningâ€”interests possibly inspired by her older brother's passion in these areas.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Pathfinding engagement will focus on helping Elle explore and develop her emerging interests in real estate and urban development, while building confidence in pursuing meaningful extracurricular activities. Taking advantage of her pragmatic nature and business orientation, we'll start with broad exploration of potential areas of interest before narrowing down to a specific project. Given Elle's preference for less academic pressure, sessions will be held on Sunday afternoons, providing a relaxed environment for creative exploration and project development.",
