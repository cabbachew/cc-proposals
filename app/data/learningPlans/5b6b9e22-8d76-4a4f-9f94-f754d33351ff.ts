    "Personalized Learning Plan: Executive Function Academic Mentorship for Maeve",
  overview: {
    studentBlurb:
      "Maeve is a thoughtful 8th grader at the American School in London who demonstrates strong memorization skills but struggles with organization, direction-following, and self-confidence. She has a 'head in the clouds' quality that affects her academic performance and self-esteem. Described as quiet and reserved, Maeve enjoys creative writing and reading, particularly dystopian novels and murder mysteries. Previously successful in a smaller school environment, she's now experiencing challenges that have impacted her grades and confidence. She may have learning differences related to auditory processing that are currently being assessed.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This engagement combines Academic Mentorship with both Executive Functioning and Pathfinding support to address Maeve's specific needs. The mentor will serve as a relatable female role model who can help rebuild Maeve's academic confidence while implementing practical organization and direction-following strategies. Through nurturing her interests in creative writing and storytelling, the mentor will help Maeve identify her strengths while developing compensatory strategies for learning challenges. The engagement will focus on cultivating self-awareness, exploring personal interests, and establishing structured routines that support academic success and personal growth.",
