    studentBlurb:
      "Armaan is a gifted 8th grader from San Francisco who combines exceptional academic achievement (4.0 GPA, Math Olympiad winner) with unique interests in sailing and maritime law. As a high-functioning autistic student, he excels in structured environments and demonstrates remarkable ability to engage with adults in sophisticated conversations, though he faces challenges in peer interactions. Active in sailing at St. Francis Yacht Club, fencing, and yearbook editing, he brings a goal-oriented approach to his pursuits while working to develop his writing skills and social interactions.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This engagement will focus on developing a structured advocacy project that combines Armaan's passion for sailing with his interest in maritime law and youth rights. Through clear milestones and accountability frameworks, we'll help him create an initiative that leverages his exceptional communication abilities with adults while building confidence in peer interactions. The pathfinding and executive functioning components will provide the structure he needs for high school transition while supporting his growth in writing and project management.",
