  overview: {
    studentBlurb:
      "Josie is a bright, emotionally intelligent 16-year-old 10th grader at Latin School of Chicago. She demonstrates exceptional ability to connect deeply with people and has maturity beyond her years. As a humanities-oriented student, she excels in English, history, and journalism while being naturally intellectually curious. She enjoys creative writing, poetry, and volunteers at nursing homes, showing her kind-hearted nature and comfort in her own skin. Though highly coachable and receptive to mentorship, Josie could benefit from more focus and structure to channel her creative talents into concrete projects.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This engagement focuses on developing a creative platform passion project that bridges generations through storytelling. As a project-driven achiever who needs accountability, Josie will work with a mentor who serves as both an accountability coach and 'older sister' role model. The mentor will help structure ambitious goals while maintaining high expectations, challenging Josie to transform her creative ideas into action. With executive functioning support integrated throughout, this engagement will help Josie develop discipline around creative projects while nurturing her natural talents in connecting with others.",
