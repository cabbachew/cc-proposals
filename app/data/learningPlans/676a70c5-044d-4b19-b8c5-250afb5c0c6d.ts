As the quarterback of Riverdale's football team with strong interpersonal skills and high emotional intelligence, Will excels in connecting with others and is taking honors math and two science courses (Biochem 2 and Microbiology). He has already developed a website called 'AFA Youth' focused on Alzheimer's awareness, which includes a GoFundMe component, and is now expanding it to incorporate his passion for sports medicine and brain health.",

      "This Passion Project engagement is guiding Will in developing his initiative into a comprehensive website that bridges his interests in Alzheimer's awareness and sports medicine. The mentor provides structure, clear direction, and accountability to help Will create content that uniquely represents his interests and concerns. Will's site is evolving from a purely Alzheimer's-focused platform to a more comprehensive brain health resource tentatively titled 'The Tackle Zone' (Training, Awareness, Concussion, Knowledge, Lifestyle Education). The mentor and Will are working together to create blog posts, conduct expert interviews, and develop fundraising strategies that connect his personal experience with Alzheimer's to his passion for football and sports medicine.",
