    studentBlurb:
      "Ishmael is a technically-minded seventh grader at a micro-school in Dakar, Senegal, with a unique multicultural background. Born to an American household but educated in French, he demonstrates strong problem-solving abilities and mechanical aptitude. Ishmael excels in mathematics and shows growing confidence in his academics, including recent improvement in French. A reserved yet practical student, he enjoys hands-on activities like fixing jet skis and has shown natural entrepreneurial initiative by securing a summer job at the beach. His interests span from Manchester United football to photography and digital content creation using tools like Canva.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Pathfinding engagement will blend Ishmael's technical interests with digital content creation, focusing on practical applications that align with his hands-on learning style. Given his emerging interest in both engineering and content creation, we'll explore projects that combine technical problem-solving with digital media production. The mentor will guide him in channeling his screen time into creative projects while supporting his English writing development through engaging, sports-focused content creation.",
