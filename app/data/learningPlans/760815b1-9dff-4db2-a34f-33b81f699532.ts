    studentBlurb:
      "Audrey is a determined and compassionate 9th grader with a strong interest in community service, particularly focused on helping underserved populations. She is currently involved in Science Olympiad, youth orchestra, UNICEF, and volunteers with refugees. Audrey is academically focused, taking three AP classes, and is an accomplished violinist. She's looking to develop leadership skills and create meaningful impact in her community through a passion project that would combine her interests in health equity, community service, and social impact. She has a particular interest in supporting underserved communities and is drawn to health-related initiatives.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Passion Project aims to help Audrey develop a meaningful health equity initiative with tangible community impact that she can lead from start to finish. With pathfinding support, we'll explore how Audrey can transform her interest in serving vulnerable populations into a structured organization or content platform that demonstrates her leadership abilities and commitment to social change. Whether through establishing a local chapter of an existing health equity organization, creating a new nonprofit focused on addressing health disparities, or developing educational content on health topics, this engagement will help Audrey build a project that aligns with her values while creating a compelling narrative for college applications.",
