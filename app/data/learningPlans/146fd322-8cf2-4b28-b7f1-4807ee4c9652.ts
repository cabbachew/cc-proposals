    "Personalized Learning Plan: Food Policy & Social Impact Project for Cameron",
  overview: {
    studentBlurb:
      "Cameron is a thoughtful, empathetic 10th grader at Riverdale who demonstrates a natural curiosity about social causes, particularly food policy, nutrition, and sustainability. Through her first five sessions, she has shown genuine interest in the intersection of food systems, policy, and business, creating content on composting in NYC and researching the California School Food Safety Act. Cameron has begun developing a food policy website called 'Sustainabites NYC' with sections for informative insights, news updates, and local resources. She is involved in the Friendly Fridge club at school and has applied to join a youth steering committee focused on implementing healthier foods in school cafeterias. With strong academic interests in math, history, and bioethics, Cameron brings a unique perspective to complex social issues while actively looking for ways to create meaningful impact in her community.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This engagement combines Passion Project development with Pathfinding support to help Cameron explore the intersection of food policy, social justice, and community impact. Building on her successful first month where she began creating her 'Sustainabites NYC' website and drafted her first articles on composting and food safety, Cameron will continue developing content while refining her focus area within food policy. The project will evolve to include potential interviews with food industry professionals, analysis of school food options, and community engagement through her Friendly Fridge club. By connecting her academic interests with real-world applications, Cameron will build practical skills in advocacy, leadership, and communication while developing a compelling narrative for future college applications and creating positive change in her community.",
