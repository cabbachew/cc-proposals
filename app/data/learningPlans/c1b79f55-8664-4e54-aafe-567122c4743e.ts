    "Personalized Learning Plan: Academic Mentorship in Writing with Pathfinding",

  overview: {
    studentBlurb:
      "Dylan is a dynamic 9th grader at Greenwich Country Day School who excels in honors courses while balancing varsity lacrosse, squash, student government, and community service. She demonstrates particular interest in government systems, comparative politics, and history, and is considering a potential future in law or the humanities. Dylan has shown initiative by enrolling in a summer writing course at Columbia to strengthen her analytical writing skills. As a sociable, outgoing student who values connection with others, Dylan looks up to older female role models and would benefit from guidance in developing her writing skills while exploring her academic interests.",

    engagementBlurb:
      "This engagement will focus on helping Dylan explore comparative government systems while developing a passion project that showcases her writing skills and interest in law and history. Through interactive exploration of different governmental structures and their comparison to the US system, Dylan will develop both knowledge of political systems and strengthen her analytical writing abilities. The mentorship will also support her upcoming end-of-year presentation of learning and complement her summer writing course at Columbia. As a student who values social connection and looks up to older role models, Dylan will benefit from an interactive, discussion-based approach rather than lecture-heavy sessions.",
