    studentBlurb:
      "Sanjay is an 11th grader at New Canaan High School in Connecticut with exceptional talent in computer science and game design. He has experience with Python, JavaScript, and Lua (for Roblox), and is taking AP Computer Science Principles and 3D Animation courses. While technically gifted and quick at solving problems, Sanjay struggles with project completion, maintaining focus on larger initiatives, and breaking down complex projects into manageable steps. He excels when he has a good rapport with teachers and is primarily interested in pursuing computer science in college, with aspirations to work at major tech companies like Microsoft or Sony.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Passion Project mentorship will focus on building a compelling portfolio of coding and game design projects that showcase Sanjay's technical abilities while incorporating Pathfinding to explore career opportunities and potential internships in his field. We'll structure the engagement to help Sanjay overcome his challenges with project completion by breaking complex tasks into manageable milestones and providing consistent accountability. Given Sanjay's preference for mentors who establish trust, sessions will balance technical guidance with relationship-building to foster a productive partnership. We'll gradually expand from small achievable projects to more ambitious ones, with a particular focus on game design and AI integration that aligns with his interests and college aspirations.",
