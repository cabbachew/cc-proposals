She shows particular enthusiasm for brand collaborations like SKIMS x NBA and has begun developing her eye for style through outfit curation. Macy demonstrates an authentic interest in how partnerships form between sports and fashion brands, and has started exploring visual creativity through styling board creation.",

      "This passion project explores the intersection of sports, fashion, and marketing through the lens of Macy's interests in basketball and style. Building on her successful first session where she began creating styling boards using Google Slides, Macy will continue developing skills in trend analysis, visual storytelling, and brand partnership concepts. The project will focus on creating a portfolio of styling work and collaboration ideas that showcase her unique perspective, with particular emphasis on basketball-related fashion and partnerships. Sessions will be held on Tuesdays as established in the initial meeting, with a flexible approach that allows Macy to drive creative decisions while receiving structured guidance.",
