    studentBlurb:
      "Quinn is a dynamic 10th grader at Marin Academy with excellent communication skills and a growing passion for child psychology and special needs education. She's a verbal and visual learner who excels in writing, humanities, and connecting with people. Quinn navigates challenges with ADHD and executive function but maintains a strong 3.5-3.6 GPA. Extracurricularly, she's active in field hockey, soccer, mock trial, and has recently begun exploring various clubs and interests. Quinn is notably social, empathetic, and engaging - qualities that help her connect easily with peers and adults alike. She's already planning to attend a psychology program at Brown University this summer and is eager to build meaningful experiences that align with her emerging interests in psychology, education, and content creation.",
    engagementBlurb:
      "This Passion Project mentorship will focus on content creation around child psychology and education, combining Quinn's natural strengths in communication and writing with her emerging interest in psychology. The engagement will incorporate both Pathfinding to explore future academic and career possibilities, and Executive Functioning support to develop sustainable organizational systems. Given Quinn's social nature and verbal learning style, sessions will emphasize interactive discussion, interviewing techniques, and collaborative planning. The mentor will help Quinn develop and execute a compelling content creation project that showcases her empathy and communication skills while building the organizational foundation needed for academic success in college. With Quinn's recent surge in interest exploration, the mentor will help connect these dots into a cohesive narrative that supports her college aspirations.",
