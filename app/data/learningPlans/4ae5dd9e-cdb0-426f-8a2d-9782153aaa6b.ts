    "Personalized Learning Plan: Sports Analytics Portfolio Development & Growth",

  overview: {
    studentBlurb:
      "Atharv is an academically strong 8th grader at Dartmouth Middle School who has already demonstrated significant achievement in developing technical and analytical skills. Through his mentorship, he has mastered R programming fundamentals and created a sophisticated NBA player ranking system, publishing regular analytical content on his Substack. A dedicated student ranking in the top 10% nationally in math tournaments, Atharv combines strong analytical abilities with genuine passion for sports, particularly basketball, where he shows commitment through his travel team participation. His exceptional work ethic and determination are evident in both his academic achievements and his response to challenges, such as continuing basketball training after not making the middle school team.",

    engagementBlurb:
      "Building on Atharv's successful development of R programming skills and his sports analytics platform, this next phase focuses on expanding his project's impact and reach while preparing for future opportunities. The engagement will support Atharv in growing his analytical platform beyond project documentation into an active publication, developing his portfolio for high school opportunities, and exploring ways to bring sports analytics into his future academic environment. Working with his mentor, Atharv will transform his current work into sustainable, long-term achievements that demonstrate his sustained interest in sports analytics and data science.",
